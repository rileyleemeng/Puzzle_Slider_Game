The Puzzle Slider Game is structured to four modules to facilitate gameplay, 
user interaction, and score management.

The GameBoard module is responsible for the core mechanics. 
It initializes the puzzle board, and all puzzles can be loaded from .puz files, 
which contain metadata and logic to shuffle tiles, handle tile swapping, check for move validity, 
completion status, and whether the player has failed the game based on the move limit.

The ScreenManager class handles all screen elements of the game. 
It displays the game's splash screen, several setup buttons, game board, status updates, user inputs 
for their name, number of moves, and puzzle selection. Game completion or failure determines if images 
are displayed.

The Leaderboard class deals with tracking and displaying player scores. 
It reads from and writes to a leaderboard file, keeping a record of the lowest number of moves 
used to solve puzzles. If the leaderboard file is missing, the class is designed to log an error 
and create a new file as necessary.

The main game file puzzle_game.py brings together all these components, 
it initializes the game, loads the first puzzle, and handles the main game loop.
